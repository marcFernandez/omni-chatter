## Twitch bot (for now)

This is a random project being developed live at my [twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/zartisimo) (don't know
how long I'll keep streaming).

Update: Now it also has a UI where you can update the commands too

### Why are you building this?

Because I'm learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

### Episodes

1. Twitch integration and command parsing ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2014622800))
2. File persistence, refactoring and first multithreading ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2016632984))
3. Add "create" commands and start building GUI ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2018412068))
    ![First version of GUI](images/gui_v0.png)
4. Add "remove" commands in UI and colorful toasts ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2020135440))
    ![Second version of GUI](images/gui_v1.png)
5. Add twitch chat to UI ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2022171772))

6. Add configurable font size and some UI adjustments (no video :()
7. Explore sending messages from the UI
8. UI fixes and start youtube integration
9. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Goal

Create a multipurpose bot connected to different streaming platforms where you can configure commands
and view combined chats. The planned platforms are:

- Twitch
- Youtube
- Kick
- Twitter
